# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe (Python)

Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe**, a simple command-line game built in Python! Play against a friend in this classic two-player game.  

## 🎯 Game Rules  
- **Player 1** is **X**, and **Player 2** is **O**.  
- Players take turns choosing a position (1-9) on a 3x3 grid.  
- The first player to get **three in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
- If the grid is full and no player has won, it's a **draw**.  
- Type `Q` anytime to quit the game.

## 🚀 How to Play  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```
3. Run the game:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Numbered Board (Pick a spot to play):**  
```
 1 | 2 | 3

```
**Actual Gameplay Board (After some moves):**  
```
 X | O | X  
--------------

```
